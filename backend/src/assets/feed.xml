                    <p>University-affiliated research initiatives received more than $13 million in grants from FTX Future Fund, with several students getting $100,000 in grants. </p>
                    <p><p>The collapse of the FTX exchange and its subsidiaries in November 2022 also led to the shutdown of its philanthropic arm, FTX Future Fund. The philanthropic arm had pledged $1 billion in donations in 2022 towards research academics across prestigious universities. However, the team behind the project <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xafpj3on76uRDoBja/the-ftx-future-fund-team-has-resigned-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">resigned</a> right after FTX <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-ftx-us-and-alameda-file-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-in-us-sbf-resigns">filed for bankruptcy</a> on Nov. 11, 2022.</p><p>Many scholars and researchers who were early recipients of the grant are now stuck in limbo over payment of further grants for their programs. According to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/collapse-ftx-deprives-academics-grants-stokes-fears-forced-repayment-2023-04-06/?rpc=401&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report </a>published by Reuters, many Ph.D. students who were studying on the FTX grant were forced to drop out of the course owing to the fear of repayment.</p><p>A summary of the FTX Future Fund's activities revealed that the fund was sponsored by former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. The focus of the grant revolved around research projects for the safe development of artificial intelligence, reducing catastrophic bio-risk, improving institutions, economic growth, great power relations, and effective altruism, among many others. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ We&#39;re thrilled to announce the FTX Foundation&#39;s Future Fund. We make grants and investments to ambitious projects to improve humanity&#39;s long-term prospects.<br><br>We plan to deploy &gt;$100M this year, and potentially a lot more (in principle up to $1B).<a href="https://t.co/kIWdm48LZ4">https://t.co/kIWdm48LZ4</a></p>&mdash; Future Fund (@ftxfuturefund) <a href="https://twitter.com/ftxfuturefund/status/1498350483206860801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2022</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>According to the report, a total of 20 academics from prestigious colleges, including Cornell, Princeton, and Brown in the United States, as well as Cambridge in Britain, received grants from the FTX philanthropy arm totaling more than $100,000 each. Further calculations based on these announcements suggest university-affiliated research initiatives got a total of more than $13 million.</p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/names-of-non-us-ftx-users-demanded-by-mainstream-media-outlets">Names of non-US FTX users demanded by mainstream media outlets</a></em></strong></p><p>Many of these academics who received the first grant have now found themselves in a tricky situation with the next due date for fee submission already passed. As a result, many of the students were forced to drop out of the program after the first year. </p><p>Others who did receive a full grant have found themselves in an ethical battle over whether to use the grant or return the funds, which might be part of stolen customers' funds, as per the lawsuit against the crypto exchange and its founders.</p><p>While FTX asked recipients of payments from the debtors in the FTX bankruptcy filing to return their funds in an announcement, it didn’t specifically mention FTX Futures Funds. However, a lawyer based in the U.S. suggested that it will depend on the FTX trustee and their willingness to claw back small amounts, including philanthropic ones.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/us-enforcement-agencies-turning-up-heat-crypto-related-crime/">US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime</a></em></strong></p><template data-name="subscription_form" data-type="law_decoded"></template></p>

                    <p>Foreign direct investment in Nigeria fell by 33% last year due to a severe shortage of dollars, which discouraged crypto companies from expanding into the country.</p>
                    <p><p>The largest economy in Africa has a foreign investment problem despite exponential growth in crypto adoption.</p><p>The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported on Tuesday that foreign direct investment (FDI) in Nigeria, the largest economy in Africa, dropped by 33% last year due to a severe shortage of dollars. The shortage has also discouraged crypto companies from expanding into the country. In 2022, investment declined to $468 million from the previous year’s $698 million. According to the data, FDI has decreased by approximately 90% since its peak of $4.7 billion in 2008.</p><p>The adoption of crypto in Nigeria has grown at an exponential rate. The country has active adult crypto traders, with many citizens now preferring to store their money in digital currencies over fiat cash due to the constant devaluation of the national currency, the naira. In Chainalysis’ 2020 Cryptocurrency Geography Report, Nigeria <a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/rs/503-FAP-074/images/2020-Geography-of-Crypto.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ranked</a> eighth in crypto adoption and usage rate among 154 countries included in the study. This adoption rate is expected to have encouraged more foreign crypto investment in the nation but the reverse is the case.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/a80ffa49-1613-42f2-9858-d8dd6e199f0a.jpeg"><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>Foreign direct investment into Nigeria plunges. Source: Bloomberg</em></figcaption></figure><p>In an interview with Cointelegraph, local data analyst and crypto enthusiast, Obinna Uzoije, said the low rate of foreign investment in Nigeria could be attributed to the fact that the use of cryptocurrency was yet to go mainstream in the country. Uzoije explained that the lack of use of crypto in day-to-day economic activities and the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-bank-of-nigeria-bans-banks-from-servicing-crypto-exchanges" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/central-bank-of-nigeria-bans-banks-from-servicing-crypto-exchanges/amp">ban on financial institutions</a> from servicing crypto exchanges were to be blamed for the low investment rate.</p><p>As part of the 2021 ban, the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/top-people-in-crypto-and-blockchain-2023/central-bank-of-nigeria">Central Bank of Nigeria</a> directed all commercial banks to close accounts belonging to crypto exchanges and other businesses transacting in cryptocurrencies in the country.</p><p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/TokunboAdesina/status/1643491778484400128" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tweet</a>, Olumide Adesina, a certified investment trader, reacted to the NBS report by saying that despite Nigerians “loving” crypto, fintech and entertainment, no state has taken the initiative to attract foreign investors in those areas.

                    <p>Community members responded to the new development, with some praising Reddit’s marketing efforts and changing the anti-NFT narrative within the platform.</p>

                    <p style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 15px; width:240px;"><img src="https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/840_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy84ODQ2MzZkMmViZmVkNDdiNzI3MzI1ZDhlMzZjMWE5My5qcGc=.jpg" class="type:primaryImage"></p>

                    <p>Crypto trading and investing are often intertwined, but key differences remain between the two methods.</p>
                    <p><h2>What are the key differences between cryptocurrency investing and cryptocurrency trading?</h2><p></p><p><em>Despite their differences, investing and trading often come hand-in-hand. Traders can be investors and vice-versa. However, knowing the difference is still crucial, especially for those looking to start their journey into the crypto market.</em></p><p>So, what is the difference between a cryptocurrency investor and a cryptocurrency trader? Generally speaking, investors purchase cryptocurrencies with sound fundamentals and expect the price to rise over time. On the other hand, traders take advantage of market volatility by keeping their coins for a short period to maximize profits.</p><p><img width="1450" height="1229" alt="Cryptocurrency investing vs. Cryptocurrency trading" src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/28e5163ae0ae6a519fb7e77955efe3b6.png" title="Cryptocurrency investing vs. Cryptocurrency trading"></p><p>It is important to note that while both trading and investing carry a certain level of risk, investors and traders can still be differentiated based on their risk profiles. Investors are usually more risk-averse and prefer to leave their investments on autopilot; they do not worry about daily price changes as much. On the other hand, traders thrive on taking risks and must have an excellent understanding of market volatility and conditions.</p><h2>What are the pros and cons of cryptocurrency investing?</h2><p></p><p><em>The main advantages of investing in cryptocurrency are capital appreciation, hedging against inflation and lower risks than trading. Meanwhile, the primary disadvantage of investing in crypto assets is their inherent volatility.</em></p><p>The biggest advantage of cryptocurrency investing is the potential for capital appreciation over time. Despite fluctuations in price and market sentiment, historical data shows that, given the cryptocurrency market’s rapid growth in the past decade, one could potentially profit by being a long-term investor.</p><p>Another benefit is that cryptocurrencies can act as a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/is-bitcoin-a-hedge-against-inflation" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/explained/is-bitcoin-a-hedge-against-inflation/amp">hedge against inflation</a> since their prices tend to be more resistant to market sentiment changes than fiat currencies. Investing in cryptocurrencies also carries lower risks than cryptocurrency trading since it involves a longer-term commitment.</p><p>Conversely, cryptocurrency investing can also be extremely risky due to its high volatility. As such, investors should ensure that they are well-versed in the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies and related risks before investing their hard-earned money.</p><h2>What is cryptocurrency investing?</h2><p></p><p><em>On the other hand, cryptocurrency investing is mainly concerned with buying and holding cryptocurrencies over a more extended period, hoping that one’s investment will appreciate over time.</em></p><p>Also referred to as “hodling,” a derivative of “hold” and “hold on for dear life,” investing in cryptocurrencies is a more long-term commitment compared to crypto trading. </p><p>As such, crypto investors are less concerned with short-term market fluctuations and pay more attention to the fundamentals of the crypto assets they purchase. Some crypto investing strategies investors employ are:</p><ul><li>Hodl: As mentioned, hodling mainly involves buying and holding crypto assets indefinitely. The underlying principle is that cryptocurrency prices are bound to rise over time.</li><li>Dollar-cost averaging: Investors who use this approach purchase cryptocurrency in small amounts at regular intervals, regardless of market fluctuations. Theoretically, this approach helps <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-dollar-cost-averaging-dca-and-how-does-it-work" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-dollar-cost-averaging-dca-and-how-does-it-work/amp">average out prices over time</a> and reduce the impact of volatility on one’s investment portfolio.</li><li>Value investing: Value investing involves identifying undervalued cryptocurrencies with solid fundamentals and huge potential. By buying low, investors are banking on the asset’s potential increase in value.</li><li>Growth investing: Growth investors invest in new assets that are expected to grow exponentially in the future in the hope of increasing an investor’s capital.</li><li>Index fund investing: Cryptocurrency index funds are designed to allow investors to access a wide range of digital currencies. They are structured like <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/bitcoin-etfs-a-beginners-guide-to-exchange-traded-funds" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/learn/bitcoin-etfs-a-beginners-guide-to-exchange-traded-funds/amp">exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a> and mutual funds in that they hold a basket of different assets.</li></ul><h2>What are the pros and cons of cryptocurrency trading?</h2><p></p><p><em>The most significant advantages of trading cryptocurrencies are quick profit generation, secure value storage, low fees and universal accessibility. Meanwhile, crypto assets’ inherent risk and volatility count as disadvantages.</em></p><p>The main benefit of cryptocurrency trading is the potential to generate quick profits by taking advantage of short-term price movements and market trends. Some cryptocurrency traders also value assets such as BTC as a secure store of value, especially since cryptocurrencies were designed to function independently of central institutions.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies can also be <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-p2p-trading-and-how-does-it-work-in-peer-to-peer-crypto-exchanges" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-p2p-trading-and-how-does-it-work-in-peer-to-peer-crypto-exchanges/amp">traded peer-to-peer</a>, incurring much lower fees than transactions involving central authorities, such as banks and financial institutions. Cryptocurrencies are also generally accessible universally, allowing anyone with an internet connection and mobile device or computer to create a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/bitcoin-wallets-a-beginners-guide-to-storing-btc" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/learn/bitcoin-wallets-a-beginners-guide-to-storing-btc/amp">cryptocurrency wallet</a> and start trading.</p><p>On the other hand, crypto trading also carries significant risks due to its high volatility — meaning prices can swing rapidly up and down. This could lead to substantial losses if traders are not careful and don’t monitor their positions. </p><p>So, is crypto trading good for beginners? While beginners can start trading small amounts as they build experience, it is worth noting that the risks associated with crypto trading are much higher than most other forms of investing, meaning that high-stakes trading may not be the most suitable investment method for beginners.</p><h2>What is cryptocurrency trading?</h2><p></p><p><em>Trading cryptocurrency capitalizes on short-term strategies, such as scalping, day trading, swing trading and position trading, to take advantage of changes in price and market trends.</em></p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/how-to-trade-cryptocurrencies-the-ultimate-beginners-guide" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/learn/how-to-trade-cryptocurrencies-the-ultimate-beginners-guide/amp">Cryptocurrency trading</a>, much like trading in other traditional financial assets, entails predicting price movements and speculating on the future of digital currencies like Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>), Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price">ETH</a>) and XRP (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>).</p><p>Trading mainly involves “timing the market,” or buying and selling assets based on predictions about the best entry and exit points. Traders monitor market news and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/crypto-charts-101-how-to-read-cryptocurrency-charts" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/learn/crypto-charts-101-how-to-read-cryptocurrency-charts/amp">technical analysis</a> indicators to inform their decisions. Some <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/a-beginners-guide-to-cryptocurrency-trading-strategies" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/learn/a-beginners-guide-to-cryptocurrency-trading-strategies/amp">crypto trading strategies</a> that cryptocurrency traders employ are:</p><ul><li>Arbitrage: Arbitrage is a trading strategy that takes advantage of an asset’s price differences across various exchanges. By quickly buying and selling assets between exchanges, traders can exploit small price discrepancies to make quick profits. </li><li>Day trading: Day traders are constantly scanning the market for intraday price variations to secure daily profits, closing out their trades before nightfall. Each trade may last from minutes to several hours.</li><li>Swing trading: Swing traders capitalize on the rapid price swings of cryptocurrencies, with a trade typically lasting between one day to a couple of weeks. Swing traders use technical analysis to identify significant directional movements in cryptocurrency prices within this short period.</li><li>Position trading: Position trading is a form of trading that also leans toward investment. It’s similar to swing trading but involves extensively studying long-term trends and patterns — and typically lasts several months to a couple of years. </li><li>Scalping: Scalping is a high-frequency trading strategy that involves making multiple trades within a short period of time to capture small price movements. As the most active market participants, scalpers make rapid trades with short holding times — lasting minutes or even seconds in some cases — to “skim” a profit without incurring any substantial risk.</li></ul></p>

                    <p>In February, Binance Australia Derivatives abruptly closed certain derivatives positions and accounts, citing investor classification compliance.</p>
                    <p><p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has canceled the license of Binance Australia Derivatives after a targeted review of Binance’s operations in the country.</p><p>“ASIC has today canceled the Australian financial services license held by Oztures Trading Pty Ltd trading as Binance Australia Derivatives,” the securities regulator stated in the official announcement on April 6.</p><p>Following the license cancellation, Binance Australia Derivatives clients will not be able to increase derivatives positions or open new positions with the platform from April 14. The company will also require users to close any existing derivatives positions before April 21, as Binance is expected to close any remaining open positions on that day.</p><p>“The terms of the cancellation include a provision that the cancellation has no effect on the requirement for Binance to continue as a member of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority until the end of April 8, 2024,” the statement said.</p><p>The Australian securities regulator went on to say that it has been conducting a targeted review of Binance’s financial services business in Australia, including its classification of retail and wholesale clients. According to ASIC chair Joe Longo, the review was related to compliance with the classification of retail and wholesale clients. The official said:</p><blockquote>“Retail clients trading in crypto derivatives are afforded important rights and consumer protections under financial services laws in Australia, including access to external dispute resolution through the Australian Financial Complaints Authority.”</blockquote><p>In the statement, ASIC mentioned that the global Binance exchange and its CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, are currently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-and-cz-sued-by-cftc-over-us-regulatory-violations" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/binance-and-cz-sued-by-cftc-over-us-regulatory-violations/amp">facing a lawsuit</a> from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

                    <p>Potential guidelines reportedly won’t have a binding force over banks, which can rely on their own risk assessment.</p>

                    <p>Lights, camera, Bitcoin: A Bitcoin Film Festival in Poland brought the Bitcoin revolution to the big screen. </p>
                    <p><p>The bear market might rage on, but that won’t stop the Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) shooters, creators and filmmakers from producing new content. </p><p>Hosted in the capital of Poland, Warsaw, the first edition of the Bitcoin Film Festival took place in March. The festival brought together Bitcoin advocates and film lovers from across the globe to sit through some of the best-known Bitcoin films and documentaries.</p><p>Hosted in the Kinoteka theater in the iconic Palace of Culture and Science, the Bitcoin Film Festival  festival celebrated Bitcoin’s growing global influence while underscoring the thriving cultural movement that underpins the digital network. Some talents from the Bitcoin movement’s first film festival, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-integrates-with-cryptsy-expanding-its-digitized-dollar-service">BitFilm in 2015</a>, such as Tomer Kantor, were in attendance, and they continue to shoot Bitcoin-centric films.</p><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xkVOJAWP688" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Cointelegraph premiered <em>The Bitcoin Farmer</em>, a short documentary about Bitcoin mining using solely renewable energy in Ireland. The film was followed by a panel discussion with Cointelegraph’s director of video, Jackson Dumont; global reporter, Joe Hall; co-founder of Bitcoin Film Fest, Pierre Corbin; and Mark Morton and Vince Giltinan from Scilling Digital Mining. </p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/357d9295-8684-4c3f-b1db-b2e8bea1bff6.png"  alt=""  title=""  /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>On stage for the Bitcoin Farmer debrief. From left, Pierre Corbin, Joe Hall, Jackson Dumont, Vince Giltinan and Mark Morton.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Pierre Corbin told Cointelegraph that he and co-founder Tomek Kolodziejczuk put together the Bitcoin Film Festival because it’s a “cool idea” for the community. Although the film fest was a valuable means of introducing Polish people to Bitcoin, Pierre explained that Bitcoin “has been very popular here in Poland with Ukrainians coming here because of the war.” </p><p>Poland borders Ukraine, with as much as 25% of Poland’s immigrant population being Ukrainian. At the outset of the war, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ukraine-netted-70m-in-crypto-donations-since-start-of-russia-conflict">Bitcoin donations soared,</a> and Corbin explains that people on the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/russia-ukraine-war-how-both-sides-of-the-conflict-have-used-crypto-to-win">ground used the decentralized tool:</a> </p><blockquote>“The human rights foundation helped them [Ukrainians] transfer their wealth into Bitcoin, helping them cross the border here into Poland and then walk them through the process of getting their money back out from Bitcoin ATMs because Poland is the country in Europe with the most Bitcoin ATMs.”</blockquote><p>Kolodziejczuk set the ball rolling for the world’s first Bitcoin film festival in November 2022. He was keen to meet Corbin and screen his film, <em>The Great Reset and the Rise of Bitcoin,</em> at a local Bitcoin meetup. However, the idea snowballed. Their encounter and subsequent meetings led to the screening of Bitcoin movies from around the world in one of Eastern Europe’s most iconic buildings.  </p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/e3f1faaf-a3c0-488c-9de4-fc3df096e9c8.jpeg"  alt=""  title=""  /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>The film festival location. Source: Linkedin</em></figcaption></figure><p>From documentaries shot in El Salvador, like <em>Bond to Unbind, </em>to a snapshot of the impact of Bitcoin on individuals’ lives in <em>The Human B, </em>the film festival showcased the most recent and notable film production efforts. Corbin explained the selection process:</p><blockquote>“If you select the right films that tell the right stories, then bringing people from outside will understand Bitcoin from the angle that we want them to understand.”</blockquote><p>A crowdfunding campaign was held through the Bitcoin <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/public/index.php/news/crowdfunding-gets-leg-up-from-lightning-addresses-on-bitcoin">crowdfunding campaign Geyser Fund,</a> in which <em>The Satoshi Mystery </em>by Remi Baillieux won the community voting segment. Meanwhile, Corbin raised satoshis (the smallest denomination of Bitcoin) for his second Bitcoin documentary, <em>The Fight for the US Dollar.</em></p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/film-review-human-b-shows-a-personal-journey-with-bitcoin">Film review: ‘Human B’ shows a personal journey with Bitcoin</a></em></strong></p><p>The film festival also piggybacked off a Libertarian conference hosted in Warsaw the same weekend. Libertarians are proponents of minimizing the state’s encroachment on daily life, and were some of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin. </p><p>The Bitcoin Film Festival organizers are mulling whether to change the location for the 2024 installment or keep the festival in Warsaw. While <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/technical-discussions-take-center-stage-at-advancing-bitcoin-conference-in-london">bear markets are undoubtedly for building,</a> it appears they’re also for filming. </p><p><strong><em>Magazine: </em></strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/welcome-sarah-show-where-analog-digital-worlds-collide/"><strong><em>NFT Creator, Sarah Zucker: The Sarah Show’s analog past meets dizzying digital future</em></strong></a></p><template data-name="subscription_form" data-type="crypto_biz"></template></p>

                    <p>A number of mainstream media outlets are pushing to publicize the personal details of FTX’s non-United States customers, similar to what happened with Celsius.</p>
                    <p><p>Some mainstream media outlets have objected to attempts to withhold the identities of non-United States customers of cryptocurrency exchange FTX during its bankruptcy proceedings.</p><p>In an April 4 <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTQ4OTc5NA==&amp;id2=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">filing</a> to a Delaware Bankruptcy Court, media outlets Bloomberg, the Financial Times, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal parent firm Dow Jones &amp; Company jointly objected to the names of the customers being redacted, arguing that the press and public have “a presumptive right of access to bankruptcy filings.” </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Media group files objection to redacting FTX customer names.<br><br>If the objection succeeds, the names of up to 1.4 million customers and their FTX balances would be made public. <a href="https://t.co/w0avsJ6JYv">pic.twitter.com/w0avsJ6JYv</a></p>&mdash; FTX 2.0pium (FTX Creditor) (@AFTXcreditor) <a href="https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor/status/1643673360050667520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 5, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p>While FTX’s debtors are able to argue for the names of creditors to be redacted in bankruptcy filings — and have done so — the media outlets believe that FTX and its customers have failed to “justify such secrecy.”</p><p>The Ad Hoc Committee of Non-US Customers of FTX.com claimed in a Dec. 28 filing that publicly revealing the names and private information of non-U.S. customers leaves them <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/non-us-ftx-customers-want-private-info-redacted-from-bankruptcy-filings">vulnerable to identity theft</a>, targeted attacks, and “other injury.”</p><p>In the recent filing, the media outlets argued that if the “permanent sealing” of the users were permissible on the grounds claimed by FTX and the ad hoc committee, “then sealing customers’ names would be routine in virtually every bankruptcy proceeding.”</p><p><strong><em>Related:</em> </strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-eu-launches-withdrawal-website-to-pay-back-european-users"><strong><em>FTX EU launches withdrawal website to pay back European users</em></strong></a></p><p>They added that “public access is of the utmost importance here,” as the magnitude of the FTX collapse has “ignited intense public interest in the U.S. legal system’s approach to the burgeoning and largely unregulated cryptocurrency market,” adding:</p><blockquote>“The sealing of the names of FTX’s creditors to date has significantly impeded reporting on, and analysis of, these proceedings, leaving the public — and creditors —  largely in the dark as to the United States’ enforcement of its bankruptcy laws in the crypto context”</blockquote><p>In response to the committee’s Dec. 28 filing, Judge John Dorsey allowed the names and addresses of customers to be <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ftx-customers-are-safe-from-being-doxxed-for-now">redacted for a further three months</a> on Jan. 11, noting that he “remained reluctant at this point” to disclose the confidential information that may put creditors “at risk.”</p><p>Crypto lending platform Celsius had similarly tried to ensure that its customers’ names remained redacted during its bankruptcy proceedings but failed to convince the judge, resulting in the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/court-docs-reveal-details-about-thousands-of-celsius-customers">personal details of thousands</a> of customers being disclosed on Oct. 5, 2022.</p><p>A hearing on the matter is set to occur on April 12 at 1:00 pm Eastern Time.</p><p><em><strong>Magazine: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/welcome-sarah-show-where-analog-digital-worlds-collide/">NFT Creator, Sarah Zucker: The Sarah Show’s analog past meets dizzying digital future</a></strong></em></p><template data-name="subscription_form" data-type="markets_outlook"></template></p>

                    <p>Canada’s head privacy commissioner is investigating the AI firm, and watchdogs in Germany, France, Ireland and Spain could be mulling similar action.</p>

                    <p>The Arbitrum Foundation has made a couple of new governance proposals following the fracas that occurred over its first attempt.</p>
                    <p><p>The Arbitrum Foundation has released a raft of new improvement proposals following the fracas that ensued after its first failed attempt at governance.</p><p>On April 5, Ethereum layer-2 solutions provider Arbitrum posted new Arbitrum Improvement Proposals (AIPs) for the governance of the network.</p><p>The new proposals include <a href="https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-1-lockup-budget-transparency/13360" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AIP-1.1</a>, which covers a smart contract lockup schedule, spending, budget and transparency. The other, <a href="https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/proposal-aip-1-2-foundation-and-dao-governance/13362" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AIP-1.2</a>, tackles amendments to current founding documents and lowers the proposal threshold from 5 million Arbitrum (ARB) tokens to 1 million ARB “to make governance more accessible.”</p><p>In an April 5 tweet, it confirmed the Arbitrum DAO came to a consensus against its first proposal, AIP-1.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/10 With the ArbitrumDAO reaching consensus against AIP-1, it's now time to incorporate community feedback, and move forward with new AIPs and documentation that address key areas of concern.<br><br>Details below</p>— Arbitrum (,) (@arbitrum) <a href="https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1643699348683870211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 5, 2023</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>On April 2, the Arbitrum Foundation stated AIP-1 “likely will not pass” due to community backlash. Tokenholders objected to the proposal, arguing that it encompassed too many topics, and decried granting <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-s-first-governance-proposal-sparks-controversy-with-1b-at-stake" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-s-first-governance-proposal-sparks-controversy-with-1b-at-stake/amp">around $1 billion worth of ARB tokens</a> to the foundation.</p><p>The foundation then backtracked, stating in an April 5 <a href="https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1643699457337221137" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tweet</a> that it would not take control of the tokens:</p><blockquote>“The Foundation will not move any of the remaining 700M tokens in the Administrative Budget Wallet until an acceptable budget and smart contract lockup schedule have been approved by the DAO.”</blockquote><p>The foundation also issued a transparency <a href="https://docs.arbitrum.foundation/foundational-documents/transparency-report-initial-foundation-setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report</a> that “describes actions taken to get the DAO up and running.”</p><p>“We have heard the feedback,” it stated, before adding that it has “worked diligently to address it and make sure the Foundation can represent, and serve the DAO’s best interests with their support.”</p><p>The two new AIPs were posted on the Arbitrum community forum and will be available for feedback for at least 72 hours before a planned week-long snapshot vote.</p><p><strong><em>Related:</em></strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-to-break-up-governance-votes-after-community-backlash" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/arbitrum-to-break-up-governance-votes-after-community-backlash/amp"><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>Arbitrum to break up governance votes after community backlash</em></strong></a></p><p>ARB prices have dropped 4% over the past 24 hours, falling to $1.22.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>The plaintiffs firstly claimed that OFAC breached a section of the IEEPA that allows the Treasury to take action against the property in which a foreign country or foreign national has an interest.</p><p>The motion argued that as the provision only allows the pursuit of property-related action against a foreign “national” or “person,” it doesn’t apply to open-source software.</p><p>To strengthen its claim, the plaintiffs argued the 20 or so smart contracts that provide the functionality to Tornado Cash should not be considered property under IEEPA because they cannot be owned:</p><blockquote>“An immutable smart contract is incapable of being owned, it is not property and the Department lacks authority under IEEPA and the North Korea Act to prohibit transactions with those smart contracts.”</blockquote><p>“No one has the right to alter them. No one has the right to delete them,” they added.</p><p>The second main argument put forth is that by <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralization-meant-sanctions-couldn-t-pull-the-plug-on-tornado-cash-chainalysis" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/decentralization-meant-sanctions-couldn-t-pull-the-plug-on-tornado-cash-chainalysis/amp">banning the open-source code,</a> OFAC is violating the free speech clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-treasury-department-would-do-more-for-national-security-by-leaving-tornado-cash-alone" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/the-treasury-department-would-do-more-for-national-security-by-leaving-tornado-cash-alone/amp"><strong><em>Treasury officials would have done more for national security by leaving Tornado Cash alone</em></strong></a></p><p>The plaintiffs noted OFAC has the authority to take action against “crypto thieves” like North Korea’s Lazarus Group, but a “total prohibition is thus grossly disproportionate,” as money laundering only accounted for <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tornado-cash-dev-says-sequel-to-crypto-mixer-aims-to-be-regulator-friendly" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/tornado-cash-dev-says-sequel-to-crypto-mixer-aims-to-be-regulator-friendly/amp">0.05% of crypto transactions in 2021</a>.</p><p>“To ban all uses of Tornado Cash is akin to banning the printing press because a tiny fraction of users might publish instructions on how to build a nuclear weapon,” they added.</p><p>The motivation behind the motion is part of a broader effort to restore internet privacy rights for U.S. citizens, the plaintiffs explained.

                    <p>Some pundits have argued the trader mistakenly put up a bid for 100 Ether that was quickly snapped up, while others believe the sale was a wash trade.</p>

                    <p>The Central Reserve Bank of Peru has released a report on the development of a central bank digital currency and promises more reports as its research continues.</p>
                    <p><p>The Central Reserve Bank of Peru (CRBP) has published a paper that it said will be the first in a series to examine the need, design and timing of a Peruvian central bank digital currency, <a href="https://kiffmeister.com/2023/04/05/kiffmeisters-fintech-daily-digest-20230405/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported</a> John Kiff, research director at the Sovereign Official Digital Association (SODA). His report concentrates on issues relating to a retail CBDC.</p><p>The status quo of competing payments systems in Peru is untenable, the CBRP <a href="https://www.bcrp.gob.pe/docs/Sistema-Pagos/cbdc/cbdc-presentation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote</a>, but the introduction of a CBDC, combined with new policies to improve the access and interoperability of existing systems, would help the central bank overcome barriers to financial inclusion and lower costs for transactions. According to the report:</p><blockquote>“The objective of a CBDC within the framework of the payment system in Peru is to give the unbanked population access to digital payments, so it is important to know their characteristics to prepare an implementation strategy.”</blockquote><p>Peru has serious obstacles to overcome. About half the country’s population is unbanked. Three-quarters of the unbanked live in “non-poor” households, but almost 79% of them have no savings. They live mainly in urban areas and almost all of them work informally. Almost all the unbanked have mobile phones.  </p><p><strong><em>Related: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/developing-countries-love-the-metaverse-rich-nations-not-keen-wef-survey" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/developing-countries-love-the-metaverse-rich-nations-not-keen-wef-survey/amp">Developing countries love the Metaverse, rich nations not keen: WEF survey</a></em></strong></p><p>Nonetheless, the use of digital payments in Peru has increased fivefold since 2015, the report said.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">En el Perú, han ocurrido tres eventos que dan luces de hacia donde va el sistema financiero peruano de la mano de blockchain.⛓️<br><br>Abro :<br><br>1⃣ El Banco Central de Reserva del Perú publicó el primer documento "CBDC : Impulsando los pagos digitales en el Perú”</p>— Blid (, ) | .lens (@blid_one) <a href="https://twitter.com/blid_one/status/1642924630053732361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2023</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>The current report marked the end of the first step out of five steps in the potential production of a CBDC, the report said. No timeline for CBDC development was mentioned. The CBRP also <a href="https://www.bcrp.gob.pe/docs/Sistema-Pagos/cbdc/cbdc-questionnaire.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released</a> a 25-question survey of potential users, due April 30.</p><p>Peru received technical assistance in the creation of the report from the International Monetary Fund under an agreement reached in May 2021. CBRP President Julio Velarde <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/peru-to-partner-with-india-hk-and-singapore-central-banks-on-a-cbdc" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/peru-to-partner-with-india-hk-and-singapore-central-banks-on-a-cbdc/amp">announced in November 2021</a> that the country would cooperate with India, Singapore and Hong Kong to develop a CBDC. </p><p>SODA is a technology-agnostic firm that provides advisory services on central banking, digital finance and the Web3 industry.

                    <p style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 15px; width:240px;"><img src="https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/840_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjMtMDQvMmZmNmEzNzktYzRjNS00MTc3LWJmMDktYjFlMmRkZDA3ZjgzLmpwZw==.jpg" class="type:primaryImage"></p>

                    <p>A decentralized autonomous organization could help solve concerns over issues including ChatGPT’s political biases and its potential for abuse.</p>
                    <p><p>ChatGPT, a large language model that can converse with users, is one of OpenAI’s ground-breaking models. Although there are numerous advantages to this technology, some worry that it needs to be regulated in a way that ensures privacy, neutrality and decentralized knowledge. A<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-a-dao" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-a-dao/amp"> decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)</a> can be the solution to these issues.</p><p>Firstly, privacy is a major concern when it comes to the use of ChatGPT. In order to enhance its responses, the model gathers data from users — but this data may contain sensitive information that individuals may not want to divulge to a central authority. For instance, if a user discloses to ChatGPT their financial or medical history, this information may be kept and used in ways they did not expect or authorize. If the information is obtained by unauthorized parties, it may result in privacy violations or even<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-to-protect-against-crime-in-the-metaverse" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/explained/how-to-protect-against-crime-in-the-metaverse/amp"> identity theft</a>.</p><p><strong><em>Related:</em></strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-has-a-role-to-play-in-detecting-fake-nfts" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/ai-has-a-role-to-play-in-detecting-fake-nfts/amp"><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>AI has a role to play in detecting fake NFTs</em></strong></a></p><p>Furthermore, ChatGPT could be utilized for illicit activities such as<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-a-phishing-attack-in-crypto-and-how-to-prevent-it" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-a-phishing-attack-in-crypto-and-how-to-prevent-it/amp"> phishing scams</a><u> </u>or social engineering attacks. By mimicking a human discussion, ChatGPT could deceive users into disclosing private information or taking actions they wouldn’t ordinarily do. It is critical that OpenAI institute clear policies and procedures for managing and storing user data to allay these privacy worries. A DAO can make sure that the data gathered by ChatGPT is stored in a decentralized manner, where users have more control over their data and where it can only be accessed by authorized entities. </p><p>Secondly, there is a growing concern about political bias in artificial intelligence models, and ChatGPT is no exception. Some fear that when these models develop further, they could unintentionally reinforce existing societal biases or perhaps introduce new ones. The AI chatbot can also be used to disseminate propaganda or false information. This may result in unfair or unjust outcomes that have a negative effect on both individuals and communities. Biased replies may result from the model, reflecting the developers’ or training data’s prejudices. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-miners-may-lead-the-next-stage-of-ai" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-miners-may-lead-the-next-stage-of-ai/amp"><strong><em>Cryptocurrency miners are leading the next stage of AI</em></strong></a></p><p>A DAO can guarantee that ChatGPT is trained on objective data and that the responses it produces are scrutinized by a wide range of people, such as representatives from various companies, academic institutions and social organizations who can spot and rectify any bias. This would minimize the possibility of bias by ensuring that decisions on ChatGPT are made with input from a diversity of perspectives.</p><p>The DAO may also put in place a system of checks and balances to make sure that ChatGPT doesn’t reinforce already-existing prejudices in society or introduce any new ones. The DAO may, for instance, put in place a procedure for auditing ChatGPT’s responses to ensure they are impartial and fair. This could entail having unbiased professionals examine ChatGPT's comments and point out any instances of prejudice.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fair is fair. <a href="https://t.co/7nDEf6MOp1">https://t.co/7nDEf6MOp1</a> <a href="https://t.co/5KAmEXivAY">pic.twitter.com/5KAmEXivAY</a></p>— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) <a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1621707796914864128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2023</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Finally, another issue with ChatGPT is knowledge centralization. The model has access to a wealth of information, which is advantageous in many ways. This might result in a monopoly on knowledge since knowledge is concentrated in the hands of a small number of people or organizations. Likewise, there is a risk that human-machine-only knowledge sharing will become the norm, leaving individuals entirely dependent on machines for collective knowledge.</p><p>For instance, a programmer facing a coding issue could have earlier resorted to Stack Overflow to seek assistance by posting their question and receiving replies from other human programmers who may have encountered similar problems and found solutions. Yet, as AI language models like ChatGPT proliferate, it’s becoming more common for programmers to ask a query and then receive a response without having to communicate with other people. This could result in users interacting less and sharing less knowledge online — for example, on websites such as Stack Overflow — and a consolidation of knowledge within AI language models. That could significantly undermine human agency and control over the production and distribution of knowledge — making it less accessible to us in the future.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm in the top 2% of users on StackOverflow. My content there has been viewed by over 1.7M people. And it's unlikely I'll ever write anything there again. <br><br>Which may be a much bigger problem than it seems. Because it may be the canary in the mine of our collective knowledge. <br><br>A… <a href="https://t.co/YNZvFtwyfu">pic.twitter.com/YNZvFtwyfu</a></p>— Peter Nixey (@peternixey) <a href="https://twitter.com/peternixey/status/1640002493630369792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2023</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>There are no easy answers to the complicated problem of knowledge centralization. It does, however, emphasize the need for a more decentralized strategy for knowledge production and transfer. A DAO, which offers a framework for more democratic and open information sharing, may be able to help in this situation. By using<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/how-does-blockchain-work-everything-there-is-to-know" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/learn/how-does-blockchain-work-everything-there-is-to-know/amp"> blockchain technology</a> and<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-are-smart-contracts-a-beginners-guide-to-automated-agreements" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/learn/what-are-smart-contracts-a-beginners-guide-to-automated-agreements/amp"> smart contracts</a>, a DAO could make it possible for people and organizations to work together and contribute to a shared body of knowledge while having more control over how that knowledge is accessed.</p><p>Ultimately, a DAO can offer a framework to oversee and manage ChatGPT’s operations, guaranteeing decentralized user data storage, responses that are scrutinized for bias, and more democratic and open information exchange. The use of a DAO may be a viable solution to these concerns, allowing for greater accountability, transparency and control over the use of ChatGPT and other AI language models. As AI technology continues to advance, it is crucial that we prioritize ethical considerations and take proactive steps to address potential issues before they become a problem.</p><div><div style="background: rgb(239, 239, 239); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 10px;"><strong>Guneet Kaur</strong> joined Cointelegraph as an editor in 2021.

                    <p>Once again, the Bitcoin creator’s age increased by one year on their P2P Foundation profile — suggesting a birthday of April 5, 1975.</p>
                    <p><p>The legendary creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, turned 48 years old today, at least according to information provided to the global network P2P Foundation when they registered.</p><p>Though the identity of the Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) creator and thus their birthday remains unknown to the public, crypto enthusiasts took note of when Satoshi’s age <a href="http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/profile/SatoshiNakamoto" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">increased</a> by one year on their P2P Foundation profile — suggesting a birthday of April 5, 1975. Crypto users have suggested that the date — since Satoshi may represent a group of people rather than an individual — may come from a day in 1933 when United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt started taking the country off the gold standard, issuing an executive order for all U.S. citizens to return gold coins and gold certificates worth more than $100 to the Federal Reserve.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/46da649c-8bf3-4cff-b3d9-c0f10687ee09.png" alt="" title=""><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>Screenshot of Satoshi Nakamoto's profile page on P2P Foundation — April 5, 2023.</em></figcaption></figure><p>Speculating as to the true identity of the person or persons who helped create the original cryptocurrency <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/7-people-who-could-be-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/7-people-who-could-be-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto/amp">has been a popular pastime</a> among many users on social media and in online forums.

                    <p>ETH price found news bullish momentum as traders gear up for next week’s major network upgrades.</p>
                    <p><p>With one week to go until the Ethereum Shanghai and Capella upgrades on April 12, all eyes are on Ether(<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price">ETH</a>).

                    <p>After a lengthy legal tussle, the company will have to pay various fees and fines and take extensive noise control measures. </p>
                    <p><p>Crypto miner US Bitcoin Corp has come to a tentative agreement with the City of Niagara Falls that will allow it to reopen its mining operation in the city, according to a local news report. A state supreme court judge ordered its plant closed in early March. The settlement still requires the approval of the city council.</p><p>State Supreme Court Justice Edward Pace ordered the plant’s closing after “weeks of contentious negotiations” between the city and US Bitcoin on the wording of the order.

<p>Now the company will have to pay $150,000 in fees to the city, $180,000 to reimburse legal costs and new application fees.

                    <p>Bitcoin continues to face resistance near $29,000 and Ether has decided to take charge of the wider crypto markets' bullish momentum.</p>
                    <p><p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price">BTC</a>) remains pinned below the psychologically crucial level of $30,000 as cryptocurrency investors search for positive triggers. That has not stopped business intelligence firm MicroStrategy from <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/microstrategy-adds-another-1-045-bitcoin-to-its-growing-crypto-treasury">adding 1,045 Bitcoin to its treasury</a>, which has now swelled to 140,000 Bitcoin.</p><p>Even after the sharp recovery from the November 2022 low, monitoring resource Material Indicators believes the current up-move is a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-whales-push-choreographed-btc-price-as-ether-nears-2k">bear market rally</a>. </p><p>Usually, a bear market rally does not turn around until the last bear has thrown in the towel. This suggests that Bitcoin’s recovery may have some more legs before it turns down to shake out the weaker hands.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/28f92aba-6b5c-489d-8651-71cc58473920.png"  alt=""  title=""  /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: </em><a href="https://coin360.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>Coin360</em></a></figcaption></figure><p>A survey conducted by financial services firm Brown Brothers Harriman shows that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/institutions-extremely-interested-in-crypto-etfs-but-buying-has-cooled-survey">institutional investors remain interested in the cryptocurrency space</a> despite the crypto winter. It found that 74% of institutional investors were “extremely/very interested” in adding exposure to exchange-traded-funds with cryptocurrency related exposure.</p><p>Will Bitcoin continue its northward march and rise above $30,000? Will that move boost the altcoins higher? Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.</p><h2>Bitcoin price analysis</h2><p>The bulls again tried to drive Bitcoin above $29,000 on April 5, but the long wick on the candlestick shows aggressive selling by the bears at higher levels.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/45fd6c5d-b43d-4f88-9066-65622e444e07.png"  /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bears will try to build upon their advantage by pulling the price below the 20-day exponential moving average ($27,273), which is an important level to watch out for. If this support cracks, several short-term bulls may exit their positions. That could open the gates for a retest of the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders (H&amp;S) pattern at $25,250.</p><p>Conversely, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bulls continue to defend this level with all their might. That may enhance the prospects of a break above the overhead resistance at $29,185. If that were to occur, the BTC/USDT pair may climb to $30,000 and later to $32,500.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price">ETH</a>) rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($1,778) on April 3 and broke above the overhead resistance at $1,857. This suggests the start of the next leg of the up-move.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/a55f8be8-c65d-490c-b9fa-bff0c7b0ca6b.png"  /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The path is clear for a potential rally to $2,000. This level is likely to act as a strong resistance, but if bulls flip the $1,857 level into support during the next decline, it will suggest that buyers are in command. The ETH/USDT pair could then attempt a rally to $2,200.</p><p>Time is running out for the bears. If they want to make a comeback, they will have to halt the rally and pull the price below $1,857. If they manage to do that, the aggressive bulls may get trapped. The pair could first drop to the 20-day EMA and subsequently to $1,680.</p><h2>BNB price analysis</h2><p>BNB’s (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/binance-coin-price-index">BNB</a>) fall below the $306 support was aggressively purchased by the bulls, as seen from the long tail on the April 3 candlestick.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/4bc34b05-4dad-49fd-bcca-54b4d019a7b7.png"  /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bulls are trying to strengthen their position further by pushing the price above the overhead resistance of $318. If they manage to do that, it will suggest that the corrective phase may be over. The BNB/USDT pair could first rise to $330 and, subsequently, to the strong resistance at $338.</p><p>On the contrary, if the price fails to clear the obstacle at $318, it will suggest that the bears are using every minor rally to sell. That may pull the pair down to the 200-day SMA ($291) which is likely to act as a strong support.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>XRP (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>) dipped below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.49 on April 3, but the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/db7a511b-0a93-4d86-b4e0-34974229114e.png"  /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The price turned up on April 4 and the bulls tried to push the price toward the overhead resistance at $0.56, but the long wick on the April 5 candlestick shows that sellers are offering a formidable challenge to the bulls near $0.53.</p><p>If the price continues lower, the bears will again try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.47). If this level gives way, the XRP/USDT pair may slide to $0.43.</p><p>On the other hand, if buyers thrust the price above the $0.56-to-$0.58 overhead zone, the pair may surge to $0.65 and then to $0.80.</p><h2>Cardano price analysis </h2><p>Cardano’s (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ada-price-index">ADA</a>) price is getting squeezed between the 20-day EMA ($0.37) and the neckline of the inverse H&amp;S pattern.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/6cdd8d42-3271-40b6-a506-40fad643db0a.png"  /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI above 59 indicate that bulls are in command. A break and close above the neckline will complete the reversal pattern. The ADA/USDT pair could then start a new uptrend that has a pattern target of $0.60.</p><p>If bears want to seize control, they will have to pull the price back below the moving averages. If they do that, several short-term bulls may close their positions, resulting in a long liquidation. The pair may then slump to $0.30.</p><h2>Dogecoin price analysis</h2><p>Dogecoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/doge-price-index">DOGE</a>) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($0.08) on April 3 and skyrocketed above the strong resistance at $0.10.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/fd92bb6c-72d9-4b93-a482-6f653cb4cd50.png"  /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The long wick on the April 3 and 4 candlestick shows that the bears are trying to defend the $0.10 level with vigor. A minor positive in favor of the buyers is that they have not ceded ground to the bears.</p><p>If the price stays above $0.09, the possibility of a rally to $0.11 increases. This is the last major barrier for the bulls because a break above it could open the doors for a potential rally to $0.16.</p><p>Alternatively, if the price turns down from $0.11, it will suggest that the bears are active at higher levels. The DOGE/USDT pair may then oscillate inside a large range between $0.11 and $0.07 for a while longer.</p><h2>Polygon price analysis</h2><p>Polygon’s (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/polygon-price-index">MATIC</a>) tight consolidation near the 20-day EMA ($1.11) resolved to the upside on April 4, but the bulls are struggling to build upon this advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/47a3a7c9-230d-4e61-9db5-fe8e8dccfa69.png"  /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The bears will try to tug the price back below the 20-day EMA and trap the aggressive bulls. If they succeed, the MATIC/USDT pair could decline to $1.05 and, thereafter, to the vital support at the 200-day SMA ($0.98). </p><p>Instead, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are trying to flip this level into support. There is a minor resistance at $1.17, but if bulls overcome this barrier, the MATIC/USDT pair could ascend to $1.25 and thereafter to $1.30. </p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/latest-bitcoin-price-data-suggests-double-top-above-200k-in-2025"><strong><em>Latest Bitcoin price data suggests double top above $200K in 2025</em></strong></a></p><h2>Solana price analysis</h2><p>Solana (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/solana-price-index">SOL</a>) continues to trade inside a tight range. Usually, periods of low volatility are followed by an increase in volatility.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/fe9eef11-3a17-45a4-a3a3-4236021b2959.png"  /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>If the price breaks and closes above the downtrend line, it will suggest that the bulls have overpowered the bears. That could start a new up-move, which could first rise to $27.12. If this level is scaled, the SOL/USDT pair is likely to pick up momentum and soar toward $39.</p><p>Another possibility is that the price turns down from the downtrend line or fails to sustain above it. In that case, the bears will try to sink the price below $18.70 and challenge the critical support near $15.28.</p><h2>Polkadot price analysis</h2><p>Polkadot (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/polkadot-price-index">DOT</a>) has continued to grind higher toward the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $6.85. This level could see strong selling by the bears.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/8c768d6c-e621-4e39-884a-00957fd3f6cb.png"  /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The 20-day EMA ($6.22) remains an important level to keep an eye on. If the price turns down from $6.85 but rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned positive and traders are buying the dips. </p><p>That will increase the possibility of a break above $6.85. The DOT/USDT pair may then attempt a rally to the neckline of the inverse H&amp;S pattern. Sellers will have to sink the price below $5.70 to gain the upper hand.</p><h2>Litecoin price analysis</h2><p>Litecoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index">LTC</a>) jumped off the 20-day EMA ($89) on April 1 and rose above the downtrend line. However, the bulls are facing strong resistance from the bears at higher levels, as seen from the long wick on the April 3 and April 5 candlesticks.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/480738d6-c130-4c83-aadc-5ce218d4f55b.png"  /><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure><p>The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate advantage to buyers. There is a minor resistance at $96, but if that is crossed, the LTC/USDT pair may climb to the stiff overhead resistance at $106. </p><p>If bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to quickly yank the price back below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then drop to $85. This is an important level to keep an eye on because a break below it will indicate that the bears are back in the game. </p><template data-name="subscription_form" data-type="markets_outlook"></template><p class="post-content__disclaimer">The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.

                    <p>The funds will be used to develop decentralized infrastructure that enables institutional investors to allocate assets on-chain.</p>
                    <p><p>Berlin-based M^ZERO Labs, a company that seeks to build neutral infrastructure linking assets in the global financial system with decentralized applications, has raised $22.5 million in a financing round led by Pantera Capital. The funding round also includes participation from other investors such as Road Capital, AirTree, Standard Crypto, The SALT Fund, ParaFi Capital, Distributed Capital, Kraynos Capital, Mouro Capital and Earlybird. </p><p>The company said the funds would be used to build a decentralized infrastructure that allows institutional participants to allocate assets on-chain and transfer value in a “completely transparent, open-source, and composable manner, while minimizing their exposure to counterparty risk.” The capital will also be deployed to aid ongoing product development. </p><p>M^ZERO shared that its objective is to equip accredited financial institutions that comply with their local regulations with advanced middleware for on-chain and open-source value transfer. The platform intends to connect global financial system assets with decentralized applications, offering participants enhanced capabilities.</p><p>“This fundraise will enable the team to develop an infrastructure that, we believe, will revolutionize how institutions allocate assets and exchange value,” said Luca Prosperi, CEO of M^ZERO Labs. “Shared on-chain governance and settlement will seamlessly interact with best-practice asset onboarding in a regulatory-friendly setup.”</p><p>“It will be an open-source, credibly neutral protocol where providers of liquidity and collateral can freely meet in a decentralized market on blockchain rails,” Pantera Capital’s Paul Veradittakit said.</p><p><em><strong>Related: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-is-already-in-its-next-bull-market-cycle-pantera-capital">Bitcoin is already in its ‘next bull market cycle’ — Pantera Capital</a></strong></em></p><p>Pantera is one of the crypto industry’s earliest investment funds.

                    <p>The D.C.-based think tank views a central bank digital currency as a danger to citizens’ privacy.</p>
                    <p><p>A report from the Cato Institute argues that a United States government-issued central bank digital currency, or CBDC, would usurp the private sector and threaten citizens’ privacy and core freedoms.</p><p>The U.S. government is investigating the creation of a CBDC, essentially a digital dollar that would be backed by the Federal Reserve. According to analysis from the Cato Institute — a Washington, D.C.-based policy research think tank — this <a href="https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/central-bank-digital-currency" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">represents</a> a clear and present danger to citizen privacy and the free market. </p><p>The institute minced no words in the phrasing of the report’s ultimate takeaway, stating that CBDCs “should have no place in the American economy” and that “Congress should explicitly prohibit the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury from issuing a CBDC in any form.”</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New: <a href="https://twitter.com/EconWithNick?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EconWithNick</a> explodes myths of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and exposes the key risks. <a href="https://t.co/7lqW18UhG4">https://t.co/7lqW18UhG4</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/CatoCMFA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CatoCMFA</a></p>— Cato Daily Podcast (@CatoPodcast) <a href="https://twitter.com/CatoPodcast/status/1643246258746712064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 4, 2023</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>The primary arguments against the development of a government-issued CBDC, according to the Cato Institute, include fears over tracking and control, destabilization of the free market and cybersecurity.</p><p>“The private sector is not immune either, but it does have the distinct advantage of being more decentralized than the federal government,” writes the authors of the report, which continues, “Whereas an IRS breach puts all 333 million Americans at risk, a breach at a private financial institution would affect only a fraction of citizens.”</p><p>These privacy concerns could extend beyond the United States, as some 60% of global financial liabilities and claims are denominated in U.S. dollars, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/the-international-role-of-the-u-s-dollar-20211006.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according</a> to the Federal Reserve. </p><p><strong><em> Related: </em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cbdcs-could-be-easily-weaponized-to-spy-on-us-citizens-congressman" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/cbdcs-could-be-easily-weaponized-to-spy-on-us-citizens-congressman/amp"><em>CBDCs could be ‘easily weaponized’ to spy on US citizens: Congressman</em></a></strong></p><p>It’s unclear at this time if and when the U.S. intends to issue a CBDC — although the Federal Reserve’s FedNow service, a state-operated instant transaction banking portal, is scheduled to go online in July. </p><p>Per a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cbdcs-could-be-easily-weaponized-to-spy-on-us-citizens-congressman" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/cbdcs-could-be-easily-weaponized-to-spy-on-us-citizens-congressman/amp">previous report from Cointelegraph’s Brayden Lindrea</a>, the ongoing discussions on Capitol Hill remain a hot-button issue for some, with Congressman and Republican Party majority whip Tom Emmer calling CBDCs potentially “dangerous” for both individual users and the government’s political opponents. </p><template data-name="subscription_form" data-type="law_decoded"></template>

                    <p>The first Australian dollar-backed stablecoin was used with Australian CBDC support to trade carbon credits with Grollo Carbon Ventures.</p>
                    <p><p>Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) has completed its use case in the pilot project run by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre using central bank digital currency (CBDC). ANZ <a href="https://media.anz.com/posts/2023/april-/anz-and-grollo-partner-to-trade-tokenised--australian-carbon-cre" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">partnered</a> with Grollo Carbon Ventures (GCV) to trade carbon credits.</p><p>ANZ tokenized Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) and GCV used its A$DC stablecoin to trade carbon credits on a public, permissionless blockchain. Settlement occurred “in near real-time via ANZ smart contracts,” the bank said. Australian CBDC was used to back A$DC. ANZ banking services lead Nigel Dobson said: </p><blockquote>“When applied to carbon markets, tokenisation has the potential to improve efficiency and transparency, reduce risk and preserve the unique characteristics of underlying projects to incentivise investment in climate solutions.”</blockquote><p>This was the first of three Australian CBDC pilot use cases in which ANZ will participate. It will also be involved in use cases for offline payments and pension fund payments, which are <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/australian-central-bank-to-launch-live-pilot-of-cbdc-in-coming-months">among the 14 use case projects</a> the RBA announced in March.

                    <p style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 15px; width:240px;"><img src="https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/840_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjMtMDQvYjg5Njk2ZGMtYjE3OS00YzI5LTk4NzAtMjAzYWI1MDM0MmRhLmpwZw==.jpg" class="type:primaryImage"></p>

                    <p>ETH’s price is showing strength, but network and derivatives data suggest that ETH will struggle to hold the $1,850 price level. </p>
                    <p><p>Ether’s (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price">ETH</a>) price had been battling the $1,850 resistance level, but it broke through on April 4 when Ether rallied to a seven-month high above $1,900. Recently there has been a lot of speculation on Ether price catalysts. Let’s see if it’s possible to identify any fundamental factors behind the price movement. </p><p>The upcoming Shanghai hard fork could be one factor in Ether’s recent bullish momentum. On April 12, the ability for <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/withdrawals-are-coming-ethereum-devs-confirm-epoch-for-shapella-fork" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/withdrawals-are-coming-ethereum-devs-confirm-epoch-for-shapella-fork/amp">validators to withdraw their deposits</a> opens, giving staking participants freedom of movement but also creating a sell-off risk for Ether.</p><p>There are now 17.81 million ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, though some safeguards have been put in place to prevent a flood of Ether from disrupting the market. For example, because there is a daily limit of 2,200 withdrawals, the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/goerli-forked-shanghai-upgrade-executed-on-testnet-but-not-without-issues" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/goerli-forked-shanghai-upgrade-executed-on-testnet-but-not-without-issues/amp">maximum daily unlocks are 70,000 ETH</a>.</p><h2>Scalability and selfish validator risks are still present</h2><p>The upcoming Shanghai fork, however, does not address some of the most pressing issues currently plaguing the Ethereum network. Scalability continues to be a major issue for most users, as the average transaction fee has hovered around $5 in recent weeks, driving users away from decentralized applications (DApps).</p><p>Furthermore, the current consensus mechanism favors rogue miners who outperform other network participants, a phenomenon known as miner extractable value (MEV). They can quickly duplicate all winning deals from the mempool and execute their transactions ahead of others by ultimately deciding which transactions are completed in the block.</p><p>A recent example, highlighted on April 3 by security firm CertiK, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/sandwich-trading-bots-lose-bread-and-butter-in-25m-exploit" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/sandwich-trading-bots-lose-bread-and-butter-in-25m-exploit/amp">resulted in $25 million in losses to arbitrage bots</a> that were attempting to purchase and flip tokens in a short period of time for a profit as a selfish validator replaced the transactions.</p><p>Over the last 30 days, the top 10 DApps running on the Ethereum network saw an 18% drop in active addresses, possibly reflecting investor dissatisfaction with the ongoing issues with miners front-running and high transaction costs.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/d5bc7e13-ecf2-44c6-94c4-298ea247ae37.png"><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>30-day Dapp activity. Source: DappRadar</em></figcaption></figure><p>Let’s look at <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/trading-for-beginners/crypto-derivatives" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/learn/crypto-derivatives/amp">Ether derivatives</a> data to understand if the $1,850 level can effectively become a support according to ETH investors’ sentiment.</p><h2>ETH derivatives show no improvement despite the price rally</h2><p>The annualized three-month futures premium should trade between 5% and 10% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. However, when the contract trades at a discount (backwardation) versus traditional spot markets, it shows a lack of confidence from traders and is deemed a bearish indicator.</p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/c894dccb-ddb7-4a0a-9466-1b5049a3a104.png"><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>Ether 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite ETH’s 35% rally in 25 days, the Ether futures premium has been unable to break above the 5% neutral threshold. However, the absence of leverage longs demand does not always imply an expectation of negative price action. As a result, traders should examine Ether’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-trade-bitcoin-using-leverage-and-not-worry-about-liquidation" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-trade-bitcoin-using-leverage-and-not-worry-about-liquidation/amp">options markets</a> to understand how whales and market makers price the likelihood of future price movements.</p><p>The 25% delta skew is a telling sign when market makers and arbitrage desks are overcharging for upside or downside protection. For instance, in bear markets, options investors give higher odds for a price dump, causing the skew indicator to rise above 8%. On the other hand, bullish markets tend to drive the skew metric below -8%, meaning bearish put options are in less demand.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-projects-unite-to-protect-users-from-mev-induced-high-prices" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-projects-unite-to-protect-users-from-mev-induced-high-prices/amp"><strong><em>Ethereum projects unite to protect users from MEV-induced high prices</em></strong></a></p><figure><img src="https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2023-04/a1acacdb-1dee-4552-b5c3-4fd982399a8f.png"><figcaption style="text-align: center;"><em>Ether 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: Laevitas.ch</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since April 1, the delta skew has been close to zero, indicating a similar demand for protective put options and neutral-to-bearish call instruments. Since March 22, when Ether options last showed extreme optimism, this has been the norm.</p><p>Even after adjusting for the additional negative pressure from the Shanghai hard fork token unlock, Ether faces serious problems due to scalability and transaction front-runs. As a result, derivatives and on-chain DApp metrics increase the likelihood of ETH falling below $1,850.</p><p><strong><em>Magazine:</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/account-abstraction-supercharges-ethereum-wallets-dummies-guide/"><strong><em>‘Account abstraction’ supercharges Ethereum wallets: Dummies guide</em></strong></a></p><template data-name="subscription_form" data-type="markets_outlook"></template><p class="post-content__disclaimer">The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the authors’ alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.

                    <p><p>Elizabeth McCaul, a supervisory board member of the European Central Bank (ECB), has called for additional oversight of crypto firms operating in a borderless state outside typical attempts at supervision.</p><p>In an April 5 blog post, McCaul <a href="https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/blog/2023/html/ssm.blog230405~03fd3d664f.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> there was currently no adequate regulatory or supervisory framework for crypto firms but that the collapse of the FTX exchange helped shed light on the problem. She called on policymakers to address potential gaps in existing frameworks that could lead to bank failures, citing the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the United States.</p><p>“In the crypto world, [...] the very concept of borders and jurisdictions is being challenged,” said McCaul. “How can we supervise firms that have no physical borders? We need to put more thought into imagining what international coordination will look like and how it can be effective in regulating the crypto world.”</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We need to identify and close gaps in the global supervision of crypto markets, says Supervisory Board member Elizabeth McCaul.

Pending laws, including the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework, could effectively complement those from the BCBS in Europe but likely wouldn’t completely address supervision of crypto firms claiming no headquarters.</p><blockquote>“Exchanges like FTX conduct their operations by leveraging a group structure, while MiCA applies only at the individual entity level.

Typically, vinyl records are pressed from the material polyvinyl chloride, also known as PVC, and release 12x the amount of greenhouse emissions. </p><p>NFTs have been used by artists as a component of album releases, and even as a new mode for music streaming.

                    <p>According to Bloomberg, the Dubai crypto regulator is also seeking similar details from other global crypto players.</p>
                    <p><p>The Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), the entity that oversees crypto activities in Dubai, has asked Binance to provide more information about its business requirements in its efforts to tighten regulatory guardrails in the emirate, Bloomberg reported.</p><p>Citing three anonymous sources, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-05/dubai-asks-binance-other-crypto-license-applicants-for-more-information?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported</a> on April 5 that the regulator had asked Binance to submit more information about the exchange’s ownership structure, governance and auditing processes. The people close to the matter said VARA has requested the same details from global crypto players looking to be licensed in Dubai.</p><p>VARA officials have also required Binance to provide similar information, on top of board procedures, at its global group level, with queries taking longer to address given the exchange’s size and complexity, two of the sources said.</p><p>The increased scrutiny over virtual assets service providers (VASPs) in Dubai adds to Binance’s woes as it faces more pressure from regulators in the United States.</p><p>Last week, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-vs-cftc-latest-court-battle-could-alter-crypto-landscape-in-us" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/binance-vs-cftc-latest-court-battle-could-alter-crypto-landscape-in-us/amp">filed a lawsuit against Binance</a> and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, alleging that the exchange engaged in improper compliance procedures and trading.</p><p>Zhao has since <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-ceo-cz-rejects-allegations-of-market-manipulation-in-response-to-cftc" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/binance-ceo-cz-rejects-allegations-of-market-manipulation-in-response-to-cftc/amp">rejected the claims</a>, calling them “an incomplete recitation of facts” and saying that Binance “does not trade for profit or ‘manipulate’ the market.”</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My Response to the CFTC Complaint | Binance Blog <a href="https://t.co/TadyotM7HN">https://t.co/TadyotM7HN</a></p>— CZ  Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1640483997288415234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2023</a></blockquote>
